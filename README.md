# Job Application

Eighth web project in Instant's Diploma using HTML, CSS, JS and bootstrap.

## Overview

In this project I created a small job application form that you can use to apply, print and save the data in the same webpage with simple input validation.

The project is part of Instant's Diploma by our instructor [Mohamed-Elhossin](https://github.com/mohamed-Elhossin).

The website must be:

- Responsive.
- Readable on different screen sizes.
- Using JS to validate the user's input and print out any possible error.
- Save data in browser's LocalStorage.
